            <h1>About This Website</h1>
            <p class="infoText">First of all I would like to thank you for using this site. I decided to make this site because I've noticed that people are too "naive" when it comes to keeping their accounts safe from hackers. Most think that their account are safe and that no one will hack them.</p>    
            <p class="infoText">The problem with that is everyone can get hacked, everything from people straight up cracking a weak password to databse leaks. Therefor I bealive that having a secure account is the key for having your personal information secure.</p>

            <h3>Two Step Verification / Two Factor Authentication</h3>
            <p class="infoText">2FA or so called Two Factor Authentication is a way of proving that you are the one that is trying to log into your accunt. By combining something you know like your password with something that you have for example your phone is a way of proving this.</p>
            <p class="infoText">The most common 2FA works by you typing in a code on the website from your phone that is generated every 30 seconds after you have typed in your password.</p>
            <p class="infoText">In the next couple of steps I will go trough how to enable 2FA for google</p>

            <h3>Using a passwordgenerator</h3>
            <p class="infoText">Using a hard and complicated password may be tedious especially when creating it. But if its hard for you its even harder for the hacker. </p>

            <h3>Passwordmanagers</h3>
            <p class="infoText">As said, long password are tedious. If you don't know how to store them securley there are a lot of password managers out there that can help you with that. You just need to create an account and add your passwords there and most of the passwordmanagers will autofill the password for you on the website.</p>
            <p class="infoText">By doing this you don't need to think about where your passwords are and its even recommended by Saftey Specialists because password managers keep the password more safe than you can.</p>
            <p class="infoText">Below I've listed a few popular password managers that many people recommend</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#">Test</a></li>
                <li><a href="#">Test</a></li>
